        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>Prick the back of the rack of ribs with a fork or knife a few times</li>
            <li>Rub spice mix on all sides of the rack of ribs</li>
            <li>Place rack, meat side down, on aluminum foil and fold the foil over the ribs to create a tight seal</li>

            <li>Remove from oven and let the ribs rest for 15 minutes</li>

            <li>Open foil, drain any juices, and brush barbecue sauce on all sides of the ribs</li>
            <li>Turn rack so it is meat side up. Leave the foil open and bake for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove from oven, brush another layer of barbecue sauce on only the meat, and bake for another 10 minutes</li>
